# TIK-TAC-TOE-
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in Python. The game can be played between two players on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
**Usage**
To start the game, simply run the tictactoe.py file using the following command:
python tictactoe.py

The game will then prompt you to enter the names of the two players. Once the names are entered, the game will start and the first player can make their move by entering the row and column numbers where they want to place their symbol. The game will continue until one of the players wins or the board is filled, resulting in a tie.

**Development**
If you want to modify or improve the game, feel free to fork the repository and make changes. Some possible features that could be added include:

1.A computer opponent with different levels of difficulty
2.A graphical user interface (GUI) for the game
3.Multiplayer options over a network
